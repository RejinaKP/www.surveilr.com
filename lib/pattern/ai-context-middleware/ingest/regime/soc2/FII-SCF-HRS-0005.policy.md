### Introduction

This policy establishes the framework for communicating our company's core values to all personnel. Clear and consistent communication of these values is essential for fostering a positive, ethical work environment and is a critical component of our commitment to maintaining a robust compliance program. This document outlines the methods and responsibilities for ensuring that all employees and contractors understand our foundational principles as documented in the employee handbook.

---

## Policy Statement

The Company is committed to communicating its **core values** to all personnel, including full-time employees, part-time employees, and contractors. This communication is primarily accomplished through the formal distribution of the **employee handbook** and reinforced through new hire orientation and ongoing training. The core values, as defined by executive management, serve as the foundation for our business operations, strategic decisions, and employee conduct.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to all **personnel**, including full-time employees, part-time employees, contractors, temporary staff, and interns. It covers the initial communication of core values to new hires and the ongoing accessibility of this information to all current personnel.

## Responsibilities

* **Executive Management:**
    * Defines and approves the company's core values.
    * Ensures that core values are accurately and clearly articulated in the official employee handbook.
    * Periodically reviews and updates the core values to reflect the company's mission and culture.

* **Human Resources (HR):**
    * Maintains the most current version of the employee handbook.
    * Ensures that all new hires receive a copy of or have access to the employee handbook as part of the onboarding process.
    * Tracks and documents employee acknowledgments of receiving and reviewing the handbook.
    * Manages the process for updating and distributing revised versions of the handbook to all personnel.

## Evidence Collection Methods (Attestation)

Compliance with this policy will be verified through a combination of machine and human attestation, with a focus on automation where feasible.

* **Machine Attestation (Automated via Surveilr):**
    * **Employee Handbook Access:** Surveilr will use an API integration with the company's Human Resources Information System (`HRIS`) to verify that all active employees have been provisioned with access to the most current version of the digital employee handbook. This attestation will run on a weekly schedule.
    * **Document Integrity:** A scheduled script, triggered by Surveilr, will perform a checksum verification on the `employee_handbook.pdf` file located on the internal shared drive (`//sharepoint.company.com/handbook/`) to ensure the document has not been tampered with and is the latest approved version.
    * **New Hire Notification:** Surveilr will query the HRIS system to confirm that a welcome email, containing a link to the employee handbook, was sent to each new hire's corporate email address within two business days of their start date.

* **Human Attestation:**
    * **Signed Acknowledgment:** New hires are required to digitally sign an **acknowledgment form** confirming they have read and understood the employee handbook. This form is generated by the HR onboarding system.
    * **Evidence Ingestion:** The signed acknowledgment form, along with metadata (employee ID, date of signature, and version of the handbook), is automatically stored in a designated compliance folder. The Surveilr platform will then ingest this document as a `signed_pdf` artifact, marking the attestation as complete.

---

## Verification Criteria

Successful compliance is met when the following criteria are verified by Surveilr or a human reviewer:

* **Machine-Verified Criteria:**
    * The `HRIS` record for each active employee indicates provisioning for or access to the digital employee handbook.
    * The checksum of the `employee_handbook.pdf` file on the internal shared drive matches the checksum of the officially approved document.
    * The HRIS system logs show that a communication regarding the employee handbook was sent to all new hires.

* **Human-Verified Criteria:**
    * A signed `signed_pdf` acknowledgment form, dated within 30 days of the employee's start date, is present in the designated compliance folder for each new hire.
    * The metadata associated with the form confirms the employee's identity and the version of the handbook reviewed.

---

## Exceptions

Any deviation from this policy, such as a new hire not receiving the employee handbook link or an incomplete acknowledgment form, must be documented. All exceptions must be submitted in writing to the **Chief Compliance Officer** within five business days of discovery. The request must include the reason for the exception, the impacted personnel, and a proposed remediation plan. Exceptions will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and are subject to approval by the Chief Compliance Officer.
