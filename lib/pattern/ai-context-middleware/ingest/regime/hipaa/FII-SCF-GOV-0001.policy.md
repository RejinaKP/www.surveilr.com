## Introduction

This policy establishes the requirements for a comprehensive **security management process** designed to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of electronic Protected Health Information (**ePHI**). This document outlines the responsibilities, procedures, and evidence collection methods necessary to comply with the HIPAA Security Rule and the internal control requirements `FII-SCF-GOV-0001` and `FII-SCF-GOV-0002`.

-----

## Scope

This policy applies to all workforce members, including employees, contractors, and volunteers, as well as all information systems, applications, and infrastructure owned or managed by the organization that create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI.

-----

## Policy Statement

The organization is committed to establishing and maintaining an active and continuous **security management process** to protect against threats to the security of ePHI. This process includes proactive measures for preventing security violations, robust mechanisms for detecting and responding to incidents, and established procedures for containment and correction of identified vulnerabilities.

-----

## Responsibilities

  * **IT Security Team:** Responsible for implementing, maintaining, and monitoring security controls; managing log ingestion and `OSquery` agents; and responding to security incidents.
  * **Human Resources (HR):** Responsible for ensuring all new hires and existing staff receive required security awareness training and for documenting security-related disciplinary actions.
  * **Management:** Responsible for approving security policies, allocating resources for security initiatives, and overseeing the incident response process.

-----

## Prevention

The organization will implement proactive security measures to prevent security violations.

### Evidence Collection Methods (Machine Attestation)

  * **Endpoint Security Configuration:** `OSquery` will be used to automatically query and collect data on the configuration of all corporate endpoints that handle ePHI. This includes verifying that security software (e.g., antivirus, firewalls) is installed, active, and up to date, and that disk encryption is enabled.
  * **Network Access Control:** An automated script will use `API Integrations` with our network access control (NAC) system to generate a daily report of all authenticated devices and users, verifying that only authorized endpoints are connected to the network segment where ePHI is processed.
  * **Security Training Completion:** The learning management system (LMS) `API` will be integrated with Surveilr to query and retrieve completion records for mandatory security awareness training for all workforce members, ensuring a passing score of 80% or higher.

-----

## Detection

The organization will employ continuous monitoring and detection mechanisms to identify potential security violations.

### Evidence Collection Methods (Machine Attestation)

  * **System and Application Logging:** System logs from critical servers and applications that process ePHI will be automatically ingested into a centralized Security Information and Event Management (**SIEM**) system. Surveilr will then use `API Integrations` with the SIEM to query for evidence of active logging and to confirm that no critical log sources have been disabled or tampered with.
  * **Security Monitoring Alerts:** `API` calls to the threat detection platform will be used to automatically collect a daily summary of high-severity alerts related to potential security incidents, providing evidence of active threat detection.

-----

## Containment

The organization will establish and follow procedures to contain the impact of any detected security violations.

### Evidence Collection Methods (Machine Attestation)

  * **Automated Response Actions:** Where applicable, `API Integrations` with endpoint detection and response (EDR) platforms will be used to collect evidence that an automated response action (e.g., isolating a compromised host) was triggered and successfully executed in response to a specific alert. A `.json` file containing the automated response logs will be generated as evidence.

### Evidence Collection Methods (Human Attestation)

  * **Incident Response Plan:** The IT Security Team will perform an annual review of the Incident Response Plan. The team lead will submit a signed document confirming the plan has been reviewed and updated. The signed document will be scanned and uploaded to Surveilr as a `PDF` artifact.
  * **Disciplinary Actions:** HR will maintain a record of all security-related disciplinary actions. A manager will manually confirm the final disposition of any personnel action related to a security violation by uploading an email chain or a signed memo into Surveilr.

-----

## Correction

The organization will implement processes to correct identified security vulnerabilities and prevent recurrence.

### Evidence Collection Methods (Machine Attestation)

  * **Patch Management:** An automated script will use `API Integrations` with the patch management system to generate a daily report detailing the patch status of all critical systems. The report will verify that all security patches rated as "critical" or "high" have been applied within 48 hours of release.
  * **Vulnerability Remediation:** The vulnerability management platform `API` will be integrated to pull a weekly report confirming that all critical vulnerabilities identified in the previous week have been remediated or have a documented remediation plan. This report will be a `.csv` file.

### Verification Criteria

For all machine-attested evidence, successful verification is defined as the automated collection of a report or data set that meets the specific criteria outlined above (e.g., all endpoints have a firewall enabled, all critical logs are ingested). For all human-attested evidence, verification is defined as the successful upload of the specified artifact (e.g., a signed `PDF`, a screenshot, a video) to the Surveilr platform.

-----

## Exceptions

Any exception to this policy must be formally documented, justified by a legitimate business need, and approved in writing by the Chief Information Security Officer (**CISO**). The exception request document will be a signed `PDF` and uploaded to the Surveilr platform for auditability.
