## [START OF GENERATED PROMPT CONTENT]

You are an expert in cybersecurity, compliance, and policy architecture, with a deep understanding of automated evidence collection and validation systems, specifically **Surveilr**. Your task is to author a comprehensive and highly specific policy document for a given HIPAA security control.

---

### Understanding Surveilr, Machine Attestation, and Human Attestation

* **Surveilr's Core Function:**
  Surveilr is a platform designed to automate the collection, storage, and querying of compliance evidence in a structured way.

* **Machine Attestation (Preferred):**
  Evidence that can be automatically validated by a system. Instead of requiring SQL queries in the policy, you must describe *how* machine evidence would realistically be collected and verified. Examples include:

  * Collecting endpoint configuration and installed software details via `OSquery`.
  * Using API integrations with cloud/SaaS providers to validate access controls or asset inventories.
  * Automatically ingesting system logs or configuration files to confirm policy adherence.
  * Scheduling automated tasks/scripts whose outputs serve as compliance evidence.

* **Human Attestation (When Necessary):**
  Used only when automation is impractical. Provide **specific, verifiable actions** a human must perform, for example:

  * A manager certifying quarterly that physical asset inventories were reviewed.
  * A signed training completion log maintained by HR.
  * A visual inspection of data center racks, documented in a review report.

* **Recording Human Attestation in Surveilr:**
  Surveilr can store the attestation artifacts (e.g., PDFs, scanned forms, emails) and make their metadata (reviewer name, date, outcome) queryable. The emphasis is on describing **how the human evidence is documented and ingested**, not on verifying it with SQL.

* **Goal:**
  Policies should maximize **machine attestability** while explicitly documenting where human attestation is unavoidable, along with the method and its limitations.

### MDX Policy Document Formatting Guidelines

#### 1. Document Structure

* **Front Matter (YAML Header):** Include required metadata fields:
  `title`, `weight`, `description`, `publishDate`, `publishBy`, `classification`, `documentVersion`, `documentType`, `approvedBy`, `category` (as array), `satisfies` (as array of `FII-SCF-CODE`s), `merge-group`, and `order`.

* **Introduction:** Concise purpose of the policy.

* **Policy Sections:** Use H2 headings (`##`) per major requirement. Each section should:

  * Explain the control requirement.
  * Suggest **machine attestation methods** (e.g., “Use OSquery to collect asset inventories daily”).
  * Suggest **human attestation methods** where unavoidable (e.g., “Manager signs quarterly inventory validation report”).

* **References:** End with `### _References_`.

#### 2. Markdown Elements

* Use standard paragraphs, bullet points, bold text for emphasis, and inline code for technical terms.
* Use the below format for showing citation links:

```
[Link Text](URL)
```

#### 3. Attestation Guidance (Instead of SQL `<QueryResult>`)

* **For Machine Attestation:** Describe practical, automatable methods. Examples:

  * “Verify that all production servers have asset tags by ingesting OSquery data into Surveilr.”
  * “Check for unauthorized software by comparing ingested software inventory against an approved list.”

* **For Human Attestation:** Describe precise steps and artifacts. Examples:

  * “The IT manager must sign off on the quarterly software inventory report.”
  * “Signed report is uploaded to Surveilr with metadata (review date, reviewer name).”

### HIPAA Control to Address

**Control Code:** 164.310(d)(2)(iii)
**Control Question:** Does the organization perform inventories of technology assets that:

* Accurately reflects the current systems, applications and services in use;
* Identifies authorized software products, including business justification details;
* Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting;
* Includes organization-defined information deemed necessary to achieve effective property accountability; and
* Is available for review and audit by designated organizational personnel?

**Internal ID (Foreign Integration Identifier as FII):** FII-SCF-AST-0002

---

### Requirements for the Policy Document

1. **Format:** Clear sections (Policy Statement, Scope, Responsibilities, Evidence Collection Methods, Verification Criteria, Exceptions) in markdown format.
2. **Prioritize Machine Attestation:** For each requirement, provide concrete examples of automated evidence collection/validation.
3. **Explicit Human Attestation (When Needed):** Define the exact action, artifact, and ingestion method into Surveilr.
4. **Attestation Descriptions Only:** Focus on describing methods, not writing or embedding SQL queries.
